# Python-Project-Loadshedding-Effect-on-South-Africa
This project demonstrates a detailed analysis of how load shedding affects the South African economy. 
The Analysis page contains the code that was used to collect data from German news articles to see how foreign news views the crisis, as well as sentiment analysis. 
It also provides a detailed analysis of data from Statistics South Africa and the World Bank on South African unemployment, inflation, and foreign direct investment.
